My program could take 16 numbers between 0-15 to build a 15-puzzle game, which is size of 4x4.
My program will use A * search to find a path to make given 15-puzzle to solved puzzle by number of misplaced tile and Manhattan distance, give the number of node that expanded, the time use and memory usage.

From line 253 to line 284 in my code, I call those two methods together, 
if you want to test A * search with number of misplaced tile method, you can keep from line 253 to line 268 and comment line 271 to line 284.
If you want to test A * search with Manhattan distance, you can keep line 271 to line 284 and comment from line 253 to line 268.I am using sypder4.1.5 and python3.8.5 to compile my program.
