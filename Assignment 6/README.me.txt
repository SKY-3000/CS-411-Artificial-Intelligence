My program could take 16 numbers between 0-15 to build a 15-puzzle game, which is size of 4x4.
My program will use Iterative deepening A * search to find a path to make given 15-puzzle to solved puzzle by number of misplaced tile and Manhattan distance, give the number of node that expanded, the time use and memory usage.

To use number of misplaced method, we can uncomment the line 290 and comment line 291.
To use Manhattan distance method, we can uncomment line 291 and comment line 290.I am using sypder4.1.5 and python3.8.5 to compile my program.
